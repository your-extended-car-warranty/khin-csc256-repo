# khin-csc256-repo

# This is my repository
My name is Tyler Khin, and I am a student at Wake Technical Community College. This repository is part of the class CSC-256.

I like to play video games and the trumpet. I also enjoy a good walk, even going so far as to go for a walk every day for the past eight months or so.

# Coding Knowledge
I have extensive coding knowledge, as I have taken classes for Python, HTML and CSS, SQL, Java, Javascript, and am currently taking a class for C++. After this class, I will be a programmer for 6 years!
